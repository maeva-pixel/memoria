Actividad broker ZEROMQ

In this module there is a file called broker.js that execute the requests sent by the client (addinf or deleting items from their shopping carts).
The broker create a shopping cart in the database if it's the first time that a client send a request.

The files carrtito.js and carrito2.js do the actual modifications on MongoDB.

The files client1.js and client2.js are just some exemples to show the correct working of the module and test the comunication between the req and the rep sockets from ZMQ.

To execute the program the command lines are:
> node broker.js
> node client1.js (or client2.js)
